## Project Name

Ark of Life

Whale in Cloud（Not used) 


## Intention

When we live in the world, we learn to take nothing for granted. "We're meant to lose the people we love. How else would we know how important they are to us?" The theme focuses on the world of life and death, using an approach of the ephemeral vs. the eternal. (易逝与永恒) Through the experience, we hope to evoke an awareness of the preciousness of companionship and to cherish those things that are meant to be lost.


## Description

The Ark of Life is an end-of-life experience that immerses one in the contemplation of life and death. Every plant in nature, every drop of water in the ocean, and every cell in the human body is constantly moving, transforming, dying, and being born or reborn. They are ephemeral and they are by no means static and eternal. Knowing that we will eventually leave the world creates a specific focus on our activity, life, and present, and the fact that life is not eternal empowers our motions to appreciate it more.


## World-building

Given the perpetual expansion of human activities, the impact on Earth’s natural ecosystems is becoming increasingly severe. Advances in technology have enabled us to build toward outer space. The project proposes a network of vertical systems for life on Earth, through decades of continuous construction into the great beyond.

The Ark of Life is composed of numerous units for the coherent articulation of its function and form. Each unit contains three levels of world structure. The lower world is a deep-sea environment consisting of water systems. The middle world is a DNA laboratory including the Tree, the Vessel, and sample experimental pools. The upper world is located on a floating island with a teleportation interface. Thus users can connect to any unit (including itself) in the network through the interface.

All the species in the world have disappeared. The Tree archives all the living species in its proximity by storing their DNA inside. From a distance, the Tree resembles a linear timeline, embodying the life and death of species on Earth. The Tree is a tribute to nostalgia, and a potential seed waiting to be activated into space. The Vessel stores data samples of all species in Bubble cells. The Vessel carries the seeds of biomes that have the potential to be restored or expanded so that one day the Earth or other habitable sites and places can be filled with life again.

Feedback & Iteration (Yutian & Danni)


## Interaction

Users will start from an indoor space with a futuristic look. There is a tree in the middle of the space, and the tree will light up when users approach it. (not used) There are some plants around the tree carrying DNA samples, and users can hover over the vessel and read the info from a pop-up window. Stepping out of the indoor space, users find they are on a floating island, the users can walk to the edge of the island, and then a small platform appears that can move up and down, which can take the users to another island.


## 1st-week Feedback

Transformation of human cells into whale cells/sky burial

Introductory info / guided tours (e.g. biological transformation)

Jesse: reminded me of [this story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aiyoku_no_Eustia)


## Onboarding Scripts (Not used)

Lost within the chaos of acid rain, hurricanes, dust storms, pandemics, etc…

the human species has journeyed from afar.

Since time immemorial, forest, snow, desert have had special significance to the human spirit.

When you contemplate a plant, a snowflake, a grain of sand without giving it a name,

it becomes a formless door into the invisible world.

To discover the human spirit within new realities,

on the other side of a new dimension,

you never know what you will find…

Step inside…


## Narrative (Not used)

An old man flies in his cloud-shaped plane, following a pod of whales over different scenes (forestland, snowland, desertland, etc.), finally reaching a sunset zone in search of his lost youth. During his journey, the old man will become younger and younger (if using the third-person perspective), while all the good memories and happiness of his life will return to his mind. The cloud-shaped flying machine and different landscapes are the keys to each scene.


## Next Steps

Optimize Cinemachine function to create more smooth camera movements on predefined paths/tracks

Add more raycasting features to enhance user experience and interaction

Enrich content details of DNA samples and vessels by using more metaphor models

Explore spatial typology in modular units of the network, linking to more scenes to augment the experience
